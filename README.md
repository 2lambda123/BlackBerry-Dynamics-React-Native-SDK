# Features
#### Integration with BlackBerry Dynamics
Integration of BlackBerry Dynamics SDK for iOS and Android into React Native application is supported by addition of the `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Base` module.
###### "Dynamic Framework" integration on iOS
Dynamics SDK for React Native v9.0 and above integrates with the iOS "Dynamic Framework" version of BlackBerry Dynamics. The static library integration is no longer supported.
#### Secure connectivity
- Both `XMLHttpRequest` and `fetch` are secured in scope of `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Networking` module.
- `<WebView />` is secured in scope of `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-WebView` UI component.
    - On iOS `UIWebView` has been DEPRECATED by Apple for a long time and removed from [react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview) since version 7.0.1.
    - `UIWebView` support was removed from BlackBerry Dynamics SDK for iOS since v8.0.
- Secure communication via [WebSockets](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network#websocket-support) is secured in scope of `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Networking` module.
#### Secure storage
 - `AsyncStorage` is secured in scope of `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Async-Storage` module
 - `SQLite` is secured in scope of `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-SQLite-Storage` module
 - `FileSystem` is secured in scope of `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-FileSystem` module
#### Data Leakage Prevention (DLP)
On iOS `<Text />` component, `<TextInput />` component and `Clipboard` API are secured simply by integrating BlackBerry Dynamics.

On Android the following items are required:

 - `<Text />` component is secured in scope of `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Text` UI component
 - `<TextInput />` component is secured in scope of `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-TextInput` UI component
 - `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Clipboard` module secures [Clipboard](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/clipboard) API on Android.
#### Inter-Container Communication (ICC)
ICC provides service discovery, service consumption and service providing abilities for Dynamics React Native applications and allows to securely communicate with other Dynamics applications.

To implement some ICC capabilities in a Dynamics React Native application `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-AppKinetics` should be used.

#### Launcher integration
`BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Launcher` provides Launcher integration in Dynamics React Native application.

# Package contents

#### Sample Applications
- `BasicNetworking` - shows example of using `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` in different ways, covers different HTTP request types (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.), some authentication types (basic auth, Digest, NTLM), has a possibility to send data to the server of different types (text, JSON, FormData etc.) and receive response of different types if server supports it (ArrayBuffer, text, JSON, Blob, etc.).
- `ClipboardTestApp` - demonstrates usage of [Clipboard](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/clipboard) API in terms of Data Leakage Prevention. It is possible to change DLP policy on UEM and see how it affects the clipboard within the application. If DLP is on, it will not be possible to copy clipboard data from "Dynamics" application to "non-Dynamics" application and vice-versa.
- `DLP` - demonstrates usage of `<Text />` and `<TextInput />` UI components together with DLP policy option on UEM. If DLP is on, it will not be possible to do cut-copy-paste operations over data from "Dynamics" to "non-Dynamics" application and vice-versa.
- `SQLite` - shows example of using secure SQLite DB instance in React Native application.
- `UnitTests` - runs Jasmine unit tests for `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `Clipboard`, `AsyncStorage`, `AppKinetics` and `SQLite` in React Native application.
- `WebViewBrowser` - demonstrates usage of `<WebView />` UI component in React Native application.
- `FileSystem` - shows example of using secure FileSystem instance in React Native application. It demonstrates how to manage files/directories and how to upload/download files.
- `AppKinetics` - shows example of using AppKinetics functionality.
- `WebSockets` - contains `WebSocketClient` and `WebSocketServer` sample apps. It demonstrates usage of secure `WebSocket` API - how to establish connection to WebSocket server using `ws://` or `wss://` protocols, how to send or receive text or binary data over WebSocket connection, how to close WebSocket connection.

### Integrate into new React Native application
To integrate BlackBerry Dynamics into a new React Native application please follow these [steps](./modules/BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Base/README.md#installation).

### Integrate into existing React Native application
To integrate BlackBerry Dynamics into existing React Native application:
 - Check you are using `0.63.x` version of React Native.

      - [React Native Upgrade Helper](https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/) may be used to upgrade your application prior to integrating BlackBerry Dynamics. Confirm the application builds and works correctly after upgrade.

 - Integrate BlackBerry Dynamics by adding `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Base` module
    `$ cd <appFolder>`
    `$ yarn add <path>/modules/BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Base`

    > Integrates Dynamics based on your current identifiers - iOS Bundle ID and Android Package Name.

    `$ yarn set-bundle-id (OPTIONAL)`

    > Allows an identifier (required) and name (optional) to be updated within your application. This identifier is your iOS Bundle ID or Android Package Name and will also be used as the Entitlement ID for entitling and activating your application with the BlackBerry UEM management console.
 - Analyze your application functionality and decide what parts should be secured:
     - If `fetch` API, `XMLHttpRequest` or `WebSocket` is used in your code to do communication between your app and backend server this communication can be secured by adding `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Networking` module. See [Networking Module](./modules/BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Networking/README.md).
     - If you use `AsyncStorage` capabilities it can be secured by adding `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Async-Storage` module. See [Async-Storage Module](./modules/BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Async-Storage/README.md).
     - If SQLite DB is used in the application it can be secured by adding `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-SQLite-Storage` module. See [SQLite-Storage Module](./modules/BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-SQLite-Storage/README.md).
     - If in your application `Clipboard` API is used it can be secured by adding `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Clipboard` module. See [Clipboard module](./modules/BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Clipboard/README.md).
     - If `<Text />` UI component is used you can secure cut/copy/paste operations by adding `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Text` UI component. See [Text UI component](./ui-components/BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Text/README.md).
     - If `<TextInput />` UI component is used you can secure cut/copy/paste operations by adding `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-TextInput` UI component. See [TextInput UI component](./ui-components/BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-TextInput/README.md).
     - If `<WebView />` UI component is used you can secure resource loading within WebView by adding `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-WebView` UI component. See [WebView UI component](./ui-components/BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-WebView/README.md).

 - Lastly, do not forget to update the imports in your code.
